#This is a comment
#Variables vs constants
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1Name = "Spero's stars"
Team2Name = "Croydon's kebabs"

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables store a value and can change
#Variables cannot start with a numbber
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Croydon's kebabs"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Variables cannot have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Croydon's kebabs"
#This will cause a syntax error

#This is an example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values in a CONSTANT do not change
